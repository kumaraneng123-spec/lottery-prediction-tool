# Prompt:
include below as the patterns groups [0,1] [0,4] [0,4,8] [0,4,5] [1,3,5,7,9] [0,2,6,8] [1,3,7,9] [0,8] Create a separate tab for this "Predictor suggestion " where i will enter a 3 digit number same as "3 digit range" . Based on the results, I want to build a suggestion system where it should use the above pattern groups to check the last digit value . Check whether that values are following the values that is falls in any of the above given pattern arrays. give the suggestion values priority. If the patterns is similar like more than one take the recent pattern. Example: 3 digit value - 105 previous results of one days -> 1051 , previous results of previous day 1->1053 previous results of previous day 2->, 1057 previous results of previous day 3 ->, 1052 these values are different dates and in differnt price slots. actual json data is diffferent result sugggestion should be based on the above pattern for the last digit alone it should take [1,3,5,7,9] or [1,3,7,9] pattern -> since the results it dont have 5 in previous days last digit-> it should take [1,3,7,9] -> last digit suggrestion should be 9 hence result should be 1059, if some data dont have all the values in the pattern -> give the most ascending order wise digits and give suggestion and priority
